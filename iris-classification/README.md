# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

This project uses the famous Iris dataset to classify flowers into three species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica â€” based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

## Dataset

- Source: scikit-learn built-in datasets
- Features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
- Target: species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Models Used

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Accuracy

- KNN: ~97%
- Decision Tree: ~96%

## Steps

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Visualize with seaborn (pairplots, scatter plots)
3. Split data into train and test sets
4. Train classifiers and make predictions
5. Evaluate using accuracy score and confusion matrix

## Requirements

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Run the Project

Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook iris_classification.ipynb
