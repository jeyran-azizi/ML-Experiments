# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Prediction

This project analyzes student academic performance and predicts whether a student will pass or fail.

## Dataset

- Source: UCI Student Performance dataset
- Features: study time, absences, failures, internet access, and more
- Target: Pass/Fail (based on final grade)

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Accuracy

- Logistic Regression: ~83%
- Decision Tree: ~82%
- KNN: ~79%

## Steps

1. Load and preprocess data
2. Explore data relationships (EDA)
3. Encode categorical features
4. Train-test split
5. Train models and evaluate performance

## Requirements

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Run the Project

Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Student_Performance.ipynb
